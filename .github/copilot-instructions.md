# AI Assistant Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a Jupyter notebook project located in the MASH directory, focused on data analysis and visualization using Python. The project is currently in its initial setup phase.

## Environment Setup
- Project is configured for Python Jupyter notebooks
- Located in `Python Scripts/MASH` directory
- Main notebook: `Untitled-1.ipynb`

## Development Workflow
- Use Jupyter notebook cells for interactive development and analysis
- Code changes should be made directly in notebook cells
- Execute cells sequentially to maintain state consistency
- Document analysis steps using markdown cells

## Project Structure
- Current structure is minimal with just a single notebook
- Future data files and additional notebooks should be organized in relevant subdirectories
- Place reusable functions in Python modules if they become complex enough to warrant separation

## Coding Conventions
1. Cell Organization:
   - Start notebooks with markdown cells describing purpose and requirements
   - Keep code cells focused on single tasks
   - Use markdown cells to document analysis steps and decisions

2. Code Style:
   - Follow PEP 8 conventions for Python code
   - Include docstrings for functions and classes
   - Use descriptive variable names that reflect data content

3. Data Handling:
   - Document data sources in markdown cells
   - Include data validation steps where appropriate
   - Save intermediate results if computations are time-consuming

## Note
This is a new project, and conventions may evolve as the project grows. Update these instructions as patterns and best practices emerge.
