# NAFLD Transcriptome Analysis

Analysis of transcriptome data from GSE167523 dataset focusing on NAFLD progression from NAFL to NASH, with emphasis on lipid metabolism pathways.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes RNA-seq data from liver tissue samples to understand:
- Differential gene expression between NASH and NAFL
- Lipid metabolism pathway changes
- Gene network analysis in NAFLD progression

## Key Findings
- Identified significant changes in lipid metabolism genes
- Discovered altered pathways in NASH progression
- Mapped gene regulatory networks
